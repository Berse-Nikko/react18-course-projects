        A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence
        that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do
        not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance,
        in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph
        can be just one sentence long.
